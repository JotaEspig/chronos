# TODO
I think we should implement the 'flag' type (that is shown in
'docs/en/scheduling/diagrams/' diagrams) using a Unix Permission style where
the permissions of the system will be defined as bits. see:
https://docs.nersc.gov/filesystems/unix-file-permissions/#chmod

# just to don't forget
Decide either:
 - implement 'date' type as a string of format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'
 - implement 'date' type as Unix format
